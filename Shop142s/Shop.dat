# The Shop
# primary data file
# This file should (for neatness' sake) only contain
# inclusions from other data files (each datafile should
# be named according to the book - cause that's how it'll
# show up in the filter list)

# Each line of data starts off with a number - that's the
# record type
# 0 => include another file
# 1 => define a chassis
# 2 => define an engine
# 3 => define a modification

# Update - after 1.2.6, I redid the loading to accept (for the record type):
# b => unused book
# B => used book
# C => chassis
# E => engine
# M => modification

# see Rigger2.dat for more detailed information
# (oh yeah, I add ".dat" to the name given below)

# Books that I know about:
# Rigger2	- the default R2 stuff
# ShadowRN	- a bunch of stuff discussed on ShadowRN
# R2Clean	- bare bones chasses to replace the R2 stuff

# Standard R2 stuff
